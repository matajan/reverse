# Proposed solution

## Application
The application is very simple and is developed in python 3.9. It uses an embedded sqlite3 database with a table with 2 columns, time to store the request time and r_ip to store the ip of the request in reverse format.
<br> <br>

## Dockerfile
Use alpine as a base image because it is small and light. It exposes port 8000 which is where the application listens.
